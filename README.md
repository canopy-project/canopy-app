Canopy Device Manager
----------------------------------------------------

The Canopy Device Manager is a web frontend to Canopy for device makers, system
administrators and Canopy enthusiasts.  It consists of only static content:
html, css, javascript and image files.  These files can be served by the Canopy
Server or a web server of your choice.  It interacts with the Canopy Server by
making REST API requests using the Canopy Javascript Client.
